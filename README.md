# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of using git for version control

To make a commit/version/checpoint of your files follow this procedure:
1. make changes to your project you would like to keep
2. when you have your changes, tell git you are ready to create by adding the files to the staging area using "git add filename"
3. create a checkpoint ("commit") using "git commit -m message about what changes you made"
